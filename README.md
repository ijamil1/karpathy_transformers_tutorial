In this repo, I'm working in a notebook that was initially created/shared from Andrej Karpathy and is the result of the work he did in this tutorial video: https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=akN2jMhDbXfki3qL. I am working on exploring/extending the simple transformed model he built. This is an exercise for developing more knowledge about transformers and the architecture behind LLMs.
